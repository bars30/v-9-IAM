<p>Wenn Sie ein berechtigtes Löschersuchen geltend machen oder eine Einwilligung zur Datenverarbeitung widerrufen, werden Ihre Daten gelöscht, sofern wir keinen anderen rechtlich zulässigen Gründe für die Speicherung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten haben (z.B. steuer- oder handelsrechtliche Aufbewahrungsfristen); im letztgenannten Fall erfolgt die Löschung nach Fortfall dieser Gründe.</p>

<h3>Gesetzlich vorgeschriebener Datenschutzbeauftragter</h3>

<h3>Widerruf Ihrer Einwilligung zur Datenverarbeitung</h3>
<p>Viele Datenverarbeitungsvorgänge sind nur mit Ihrer ausdrücklichen Einwilligung möglich. Sie können eine bereits erteilte Einwilligung jederzeit widerrufen. Die Rechtmäßigkeit der bis zum Widerruf erfolgten Datenverarbeitung bleibt vom Widerruf unberührt.</p>

<h3>Widerspruchsrecht gegen die Datenerhebung in besonderen Fällen sowie gegen Direktwerbung (Art. 21 DSGVO)</h3>
<p>Wenn die Datenverarbeitung auf Grundlage von Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. e oder f DSGVO erfolgt, haben Sie jederzeit das Recht, aus Gründen, die sich aus Ihrer besonderen Situation ergeben, gegen die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten Widerspruch einzulegen; dies gilt auch für ein auf diese Bestimmungen gestütztes Profiling.</p>
<p>Die jeweilige Rechtsgrundlage, auf denen eine Verarbeitung beruht, entnehmen Sie dieser Datenschutzerklärung. Wenn Sie Widerspruch einlegen, werden wir Ihre betroffenen personenbezogenen Daten nicht mehr verarbeiten, es sei denn, wir können zwingende schutzwürdige Gründe für die Verarbeitung nachweisen, die Ihre Interessen, Rechte und Freiheiten überwiegen oder die Verarbeitung dient der Geltendmachung, Ausübung oder Verteidigung von Rechtsansprüchen (Widerspruch nach Art. 21 Abs. 1 DSGVO).</p>

<h3>Recht auf Einschränkung der Verarbeitung</h3>
<p>Sie haben das Recht, die Einschränkung der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu verlangen. Hierzu können Sie sich jederzeit unter der im Impressum angegebenen Adresse an uns wenden. Das Recht auf Einschränkung der Verarbeitung besteht in folgenden Fällen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wenn Sie die Richtigkeit Ihrer bei uns gespeicherten personenbezogenen Daten bestreiten, benötigen wir in der Regel Zeit, um dies zu überprüfen. Für die Dauer der Prüfung haben Sie das Recht, die Einschränkung der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu verlangen.</li>
  <li>Wenn die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten unrechtmäßig geschah/geschieht, können Sie statt der Löschung die Einschränkung der Datenverarbeitung verlangen.</li>
  <li>Wenn wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht mehr benötigen, Sie sie jedoch zur Ausübung, Verteidigung oder Geltendmachung von Rechtsansprüchen benötigen, haben Sie das Recht, statt der Löschung die Einschränkung der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu verlangen.</li>
  <li>Wenn Sie einen Widerspruch nach Art. 21 Abs. 1 DSGVO eingelegt haben, muss eine Abwägung zwischen Ihren und unseren Interessen vorgenommen werden. Solange noch nicht feststeht, wessen Interessen überwiegen, haben Sie das Recht, die Einschränkung der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu verlangen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wenn Sie die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten eingeschränkt haben, dürfen diese Daten – von ihrer Speicherung abgesehen – nur mit Ihrer Einwilligung oder zur Geltendmachung, Ausübung oder Verteidigung von Rechtsansprüchen oder zum Schutz der Rechte einer anderen natürlichen oder juristischen Person oder aus Gründen eines wichtigen öffentlichen Interesses der Europäischen Union oder eines Mitgliedstaats verarbeitet werden.</p>

 <h2>4. Datenerfassung auf dieser Website</h2>

<h3>Anfrage per E-Mail, Telefon oder Telefax</h3>
<p>Wenn Sie uns per E-Mail, Telefon oder Telefax kontaktieren, wird Ihre Anfrage inklusive aller daraus hervorgehenden personenbezogenen Daten (z.B. Ihr Name, Ihre E-Mail-Adresse, Ihre Telefonnummer und der Inhalt Ihrer Nachricht) zum Zwecke der Bearbeitung Ihres Anliegens bei uns gespeichert und verarbeitet.</p>
<p>Die Angabe Ihres Namens und Ihrer E-Mail-Adresse ist in der Regel erforderlich, um Ihre Anfrage bearbeiten und Ihnen antworten zu können. Weitere Angaben, die Sie freiwillig machen (z.B. Telefonnummer), dienen dazu, die Kommunikation zu erleichtern und Ihr Anliegen effizienter zu bearbeiten. Diese Daten geben wir nicht ohne Ihre Einwilligung weiter.</p>

<p>Die von Ihnen an uns per Kontaktanfragen übersandten Daten verbleiben bei uns, bis Sie uns zur Löschung auffordern, Ihre Einwilligung zur Speicherung widerrufen oder der Zweck für die Datenspeicherung entfällt (z.

<h2>5. Eigene Dienste</h2>

<h3>Umgang mit Bewerberdaten</h3>
<p>Wir bieten Ihnen die Möglichkeit, sich bei uns zu bewerben (z. B. per E-Mail, postalisch oder via Online-Bewerberformular). Im Folgenden informieren wir Sie über Umfang, Zweck und Verwendung Ihrer im Rahmen des Bewerbungsprozesses erhobenen personenbezogenen Daten. Wir versichern, dass die Erhebung, Verarbeitung und Nutzung Ihrer Daten in Übereinstimmung mit geltendem Datenschutzrecht und allen weiteren gesetzlichen Bestimmungen erfolgt und Ihre Daten streng vertraulich behandelt werden.</p>

<h3>Umfang und Zweck der Datenerhebung</h3>
<p>Wenn Sie uns eine Bewerbung zukommen lassen, verarbeiten wir Ihre damit verbundenen personenbezogenen Daten (z. B. Kontakt- und Kommunikationsdaten, Bewerbungsunterlagen, Notizen im Rahmen von Bewerbungsgesprächen etc.), soweit dies zur Entscheidung über die Begründung eines Beschäftigungsverhältnisses erforderlich ist.</p>
<p>Rechtsgrundlage hierfür ist § 26 BDSG-neu nach deutschem Recht (Anbahnung eines Beschäftigungsverhältnisses), Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b DSGVO (allgemeine Vertragsanbahnung) und – sofern Sie eine Einwilligung erteilt haben – Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO. Die Einwilligung ist jederzeit widerrufbar.</p>
<p>Ihre personenbezogenen Daten werden innerhalb unseres Unternehmens ausschließlich an Personen weitergegeben, die an der Bearbeitung Ihrer Bewerbung beteiligt sind.</p>
<p>Sofern die Bewerbung erfolgreich ist, werden die von Ihnen eingereichten Daten auf Grundlage von § 26 BDSG-neu und Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b DSGVO zum Zwecke der Durchführung des Beschäftigungsverhältnisses in unseren Datenverarbeitungssystemen gespeichert.</p>

<h3>Aufbewahrungsdauer der Daten</h3>
<p>Sofern wir Ihnen kein Stellenangebot machen können, Sie ein Stellenangebot ablehnen oder Ihre Bewerbung zurückziehen, behalten wir uns das Recht vor, die von Ihnen übermittelten Daten auf Grundlage unserer berechtigten Interessen (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO) bis zu 6 Monate ab der Beendigung des Bewerbungsverfahrens (Ablehnung oder Zurückziehung der Bewerbung) bei uns aufzubewahren.</p>
<p>Dieses berechtigte Interesse liegt insbesondere in der Notwendigkeit, Nachweise für eine mögliche Rechtsverteidigung in Bezug auf Diskriminierungsansprüche oder ähnliche Streitigkeiten vorhalten zu können. Anschließend werden die Daten gelöscht und die physischen Bewerbungsunterlagen vernichtet.</p>
<p>Sofern ersichtlich ist, dass die Daten nach Ablauf der 6-Monatsfrist erforderlich sein werden (z.B. aufgrund eines drohenden oder anhängigen Rechtsstreits), findet eine Löschung erst statt, wenn der Zweck für die weitergehende Aufbewahrung entfällt.</p>
<p>Eine längere Aufbewahrung kann außerdem stattfinden, wenn Sie eine entsprechende Einwilligung (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO) erteilt haben oder wenn gesetzliche Aufbewahrungspflichten der Löschung entgegenstehen.</p>

<h3>Aufnahme in den Bewerber-Pool</h3>
<p>Sofern wir Ihnen kein Stellenangebot machen, besteht ggf. die Möglichkeit, Sie in unseren Bewerber-Pool aufzunehmen. Im Falle der Aufnahme werden alle Dokumente und Angaben aus der Bewerbung in den Bewerber-Pool übernommen, um Sie im Falle von passenden Vakanzen zu kontaktieren.</p>
<p>Die Aufnahme in den Bewerber-Pool geschieht ausschließlich auf Grundlage Ihrer ausdrücklichen Einwilligung (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO). Die Abgabe der Einwilligung ist freiwillig und steht in keinem Bezug zum laufenden Bewerbungsverfahren.</p>
<p>Der Betroffene kann seine Einwilligung jederzeit widerrufen. In diesem Falle werden die Daten aus dem Bewerber-Pool unwiderruflich gelöscht, sofern keine gesetzlichen Aufbewahrungsgründe vorliegen.</p>
<p>Die Daten aus dem Bewerber-Pool werden spätestens zwei Jahre nach Erteilung der Einwilligung unwiderruflich gelöscht.</p>
